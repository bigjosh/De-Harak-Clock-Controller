# De Harrak Clock Controller Software

This is the software that runs the Rudolph de Harak digital clock on the side of [200 Water Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rudolph+de+Harak+Digital+Clock/@40.7071539,-74.0049962,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4026e66ed3e9df81!8m2!3d40.7071539!4d-74.0049962) in New York.

# History

The clock was orginally installed in 1971. Each digit contained a set of florecent bulbs, some with colored gels. There was a very large relay-based controller that occupied the space that is now Starbucks. 

![bulbs]bulbs-photo.jpg)

Unfortunately this setup proved to be very dificult to maintain so in 2015 Rockrose (the owner) upgraded the clock to use modern LED fixures controlled by a tiny digital computer.

# Controller software 

This repo contains the software that controls the clock. It runs on a Raspberry Pi and controls the 72 independent digit panels using UDP packets. The digit panels and the Pi are all attached to a common local 10Base100 network with Cat5 home runs going between each digit and the control center. The bunde of network cables runs over the roof of the adjoining resturant. 

Each digit panel is running the [LEDscape package](https://github.com/bigjosh/LEDscape) to drive the attached LEDs.

The master controller uses DNSMASQ to hand out IP addresses and maps those addresses to digits by MAC address using DNS entries in the `dhcp-hosts` file.

Each panel gets a DNS name that is mapped to its location on the clock. The top row of digits are `T01` - `T12`, and the bottom 5 rows are `B00` - `B59`.

# Operation

The clock runs continuously using the local linux time. The local time is disciplined using NTP whenever there is a connection to the internet. The timezone is set inside the `clockmode.sh` script, as are the colors for hours, minutes, seconds, and background. 

In the case when minutes and seconds are on the same digit, seconds win. 

The background is currently set to turn on at 8PM and off at 7AM. This saves a bit of power and wear as the dim background light is not visible during daylight. This is set at the top of the `clockmode.sh` script. 

# Layout

All of the wiring and controls are in the closet behind the front desk at 200 Water Street.

## Breaker Panel

![Breaker Panel](images/breaker%20panel.jpg)

The breaker panel controls power to the clock. Each breaker controls several columns, which are labeled in sharpie. 

These are AFCI breakers, so they can half trip anytime there is a ground current detected. In this case, they need to be switched off and then on again to reset. 

There is a master relay to the left of the panel that turns off all circuits. There is a control switch for the master breaker outside on the bottom right of the clock itself...

![Master Switch](images/master%20switch.jpg)

THIS SWITCH IS WATER DAMAGED AND SWITCHES UNPREDICABLY. It is therefore important to keep the "relay" breaker turned off. This leaves the relay in the `ON` postion and disables the non-functional outdoor switch. 

## Network

A single CAT5 network cable comes in from each digit box to the patch panel. There is then a patch cable that connects that digit to one of the switches. The switches are configured to run at 10Mbs/half. 

The raspberrypi also uses Wifi to connect out to the internet through an access point under the front desk in the lobby. 

![Wifi link](images/wifi.png)

This internet connection is used to...

1. Keep the clock synced to the correct time and adjust for DST
2. Provide the web-based demo control page using a Dataplicity wormhole. The page is served by a local Apache running on the pi.
3. Allow remote SSH connections via both Dataplicity and R3motiT. 


## Controller

The controller is a Raspberri Pi computer running Raspberian Linux and the software in this repo. 

The controller also connected to the switches and also has a Wifi connection to the internet via the Timer Warner Access point in the lobby. This internet connect is used to keep the local time accurate via NTP, and also provides remote access. 

# Troubleshooting

Listed expected order of likelihood

## Column dark

Likely a blown breaker, probably after rain. Find the corresponding breaker on the panel and run the breaker reset procedure below. 

## Single digit dark or stuck

First try reseting the whole column using the Breaker Reset procedure below. If that does not work, then the panel is likely damaged and needs to be replaced with a spare. Sorry.

## Whole clock showing slow rainbow error pattern

There was either a power failure or the controller is unplugged. 

Try running the startup procedure below. If you are not able to access the controller to run the procedure, check to see if it has power and is connected to the network. 


## Individual Digit(s) showing slow rainbow error pattern

This pattern indicates that the digit has lost its network connection with the controller. 

Check the entire network path from the swicth to the digit. 

1) The patch cable from the switch to the patch panel
2) The punchdown on the back of the patch panel
3) The cable running up into the ceiling and up over the roof (these cables are exposed to the elements!)
4) The connector inside the digit box
5) The plug going into the board on the digit panel 

## Breaker will not "stick" when turned on

Either...

1. There is still a wet short in the circuit. You might have to wait until a dry day. 
2. Dead breaker. Replace the breaker. 

## Wrong time

The controller lost its connection to the internet. Try rebooting the Timer Warner router in the lobby front desk. If the internet service has changed (front desk gets a different Wifi network), then you will need to TELNET onto the controller and update the network config in the file `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

# Nightly reset

There is a `chon` job that runs `midnight.sh` every night at midnight and restarts the `clockmode.sh` script every night...

```
00 00 * * * /home/pi/De-Harak-Clock-Controller/midnight.sh
``` 

Use `crontab -e` if you ever need to edit or re-add this line. 

# Digit Health Logging 

There is a `cron` job that runs `checkdigitsl.sh` every minute. 

It writes to log files in `/home/pi/logs/` with the date as the name. 

Each line starts with the 24h time followed by one char per digit. Hours first, then minutes.

|Char|Meaning
|-|-|
|.|Good|
|P|No response to ping, but name in DNS so digit was alive recently|
|H|No hostname in DNS, so digit has not DHCPed in a while and entry expired|

For example:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/clock-controller $ cat ~/logs/20180112.log
1607......P......P..............P........................................H..
1608......P......P..............P........................................H..
1609......P......P..............P........................................H..
1610......P......P..............P........................................H..
1611......P......P..............P........................................H..
```

Here is what the clock looked like whne those log lines were written...

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/clock-controller $ ./checkdigits.sh
H means host not found in DNS
P means failed to ping

  h01   h02   h03   h04   h05   h06  Ph07P  h08   h09   h10   h11   h12
  m00  Pm01P  m02   m03   m04   m05   m06   m07   m08   m09   m10   m11
  m12   m13   m14   m15  Pm16P  m17   m18   m19   m20   m21   m22   m23
  m24   m25   m26   m27   m28   m29   m30   m31   m32   m33   m34   m35
  m36   m37   m38   m39   m40   m41   m42   m43   m44   m45   m46   m47
  m48   m49   m50   m51   m52   m53   m54   m55   m56  Hm57H  m58   m59
```

This log format is helpful to see what happened if several digits have problems at once. You can go back and see if, say, a whole column went out at the same moment - in which case it was probably a breaker problem. 

# Installation

Easiest way to install is to use the release in this repo to flash a new SD card. Then `cd` into the repo and do a `git pull` to make sure everything is up to date.

Use `tzselect` to set the right timezone if necessary.

## Manual install

Clone this repo into `/home/pi/clock-controller`

Run `install.sh`

Use `sudo raspi-config` to disable graphical desktop on boot (boot into CLI).

# Starting up the clock

The clock should start automatically on boot when the `pipereader.service` starts. 

You can also manally send a command to the pipereader to switch to clockmode like this...

     echo "clockmode" >/tmp/clockcommands
     
The pipereader is a little script that reads lines form the `clockcommands` FIFO and then executes scripts in the clock software install directory. The FIFO makes it
so that anyone can send commands without path or permisions issues (like the cgi script for the webinterface), and also serializes the commands so they don't
step on each other. 

# After power failure

Then go look at the clock. You should see most digits looking like a clock, but a few with rainbow patterns. These digits did not successfully connect to the network on boot (see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/beagleboard/9mctrG26Mc8%5B176-200%5D) for info). To fix these digits, they must be repowered. Find a column on the clock that has one or more unconnected digits and then find the circuit breaker that controls that column. Run the breaker reset proceedure below.

# Breaker Reset Procedure

1. Switch the breaker off (all the way to the right) until it clicks.
2. Count to 3-Mississippi. You want a full 3 seconds here so don't rush. 
3. Switch the breaker back on (to the left) until it clicks. If it does not click satisfyingly, then see troubleshooting above. 
4. Give the column a minute to boot
5. Go out to the clock and check the digits in the reset column(s). If any are still showing the rainbow pattern, then repeat starting at step #1 until all digits are showing the clock pattern. 

# Running demos

There are lots of demos and test patterns available. 

Each has a command that the pipereader should know. Look in `pipereader.sh` for a list.

For example, to start the sinbowwave pattern (a sinbow is a rainbow by with sine shaped color curves), you'd enter...

```
echo "sinbowwave" >/tmp/clockcommands
```

Always remember to [restart clock mode](#start) when you are done! (Or chon should do it automatically at midnight)
 

# Replacing a digit panel

All panels are identical, so can easily be swapped out with spares in case of problems. 

Once a digit has been swapped, you need to update the DHCP/DNS entry for the MAC address of the new panel to map to the correct location on the clock. To do this, on the Pi command line run...

`digitpicker.sh`

Scroll though and find the old panel that was located in the replaced position and change the name to something like `deadH20`. Next look for an entry with a name like `beaglebone` or `*` rather than a good name. This is likely the new panel. Hit enter and the digit should blink on the clock. Next enter the correct DNS name for this position (i.e. `H20`) and press enter. Then save the file and restart the clockmode program so the changes take effect. 

# Backdoor

There is a hidden wifi access point in the digit 57 box to give direct access to the internal network from in front of the clock. This can be helpful in cases where you are trying to find a digit and the wifi in the lobby is not working.  SSID and key are written on paper inside the binder in the clock equipment room. 

# Extending the display

There are several scripts showing examples of how to update the display for modes other than clock. All use OPC over UDP to set the pixels in each digit. `ticktest.sh` is a good place to start. It lights up each digit in sequence with red, green, blue, and white. Note that you can use any RGB color. To run `ticktest`, enter...

```
echo "sinbowwave" >/tmp/clockcommands
```

For more complicated displays, C is likely faster than shell scripts. The beginnings of some C drivers are in `maptest.c`. 

# Getting a diagnostic view of the digit statuses

You can use the `checkdigits.sh` script to get a quick overview of which digits are working...

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/De-Harak-Clock-Controller $ ./checkdigits.sh
H means host not found in DNS
P means fialed to ping

  h01  Hh02H  h03   h04  Hh05H  h06  Hh07H Hh08H  h09   h10  Hh11H  h12
  m00  Hm01H  m02   m03  Hm04H  m05  Hm06H Hm07H  m08   m09  Hm10H  m11
  m12  Hm13H  m14   m15  Hm16H  m17  Hm18H Hm19H  m20   m21  Hm22H  m23
  m24  Hm25H  m26   m27  Hm28H  m29  Hm30H Hm31H  m32   m33  Hm34H  m35
  m36  Hm37H  m38   m39  Hm40H  m41  Hm42H Hm43H  m44   m45  Hm46H  m47
  m48  Hm49H  m50   m51  Hm52H  m53  Hm54H Hm55H  m56   m57  Hm58H  m59
pi@raspberrypi:~/De-Harak-Clock-Controller $

```

In this view, for example, digits `h01` and `m17` are working fine but `h11` and `m10` do not have DNS entries (yikes!!!). 

Looking at the above pattern of completely dead columns, it seems likely that a couple of blown breakers is the cause. In this case, use the 3-Mississippi procedure above on each breaker to to reset it. 

# The `nextsecond` utility

This simple utility sleeps until the next second on the clock. If it is 10:55:22.75 and you run `./nextsecond`, then it will sleep for about 0.25 seconds. 

The clock uses this to always start an update at the top of a second.

You can test that it works by running...

`./nextsecond; date "+%N"`

It will print the number of nanoseconds since the last round second> I should always be < 010000000, which is 10,000,000ns, which is 10ms. 

# Accessing individual digits remotely 

From the controller, you can `ssh` onto the digits like this...

```
ssh -l root m20
```

...where `m20` is the digit you want. No password needed.

# New digits

Instructions to build new digit panels...
https://www.instructables.com/id/Massive-Neopixel-WS2812B-Display-Panels/

Then flash the LEDscape image on to the Beaglebone...
https://github.com/bigjosh/LEDscape/releases/tag/1.0

Once you've check the spiral pattern, we need to get the digit ready for the clock by killing the spiral test pattern and installing the `bbbphyfix`. 

## If you are on the BBB

```
sudo systemctl disable /root/DigitPanelDemo/ledsd.service
sudo killall leds
```

```
rm -r bbbphyfix/
git clone https://github.com/bigjosh/bbbphyfix
cd bbbphyfix/
./install
sync
```

It is also a good idea to remove `wicd` since there is no wifi on these boards and it eats CPU time...

```
apt-get remove wicd*
``` 

## Remotely from the master controller

Install the bbbphy fix remotely.Note you must have installed [pushphyfix](https://github.com/bigjosh/pushphyfix) on the controller...

`./push.sh h06`

...where `h06` is the hostname or IP address of the digit like `h01` or `m45`.

Disable the spiral demo...

```
ssh root@h01 -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no sudo systemctl disable /root/DigitPanelDemo/ledsd.service
ssh root@h01 -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no sudo killall leds
```

... where `h01` is the digit. 

Then assign the digit to the clock using the `digitpicker.sh` script. 

# Logs
A chon takes a log snapshot of all working digits every minute using `checkdigitsl.sh `. They are in `/home/pi/logs/`.
